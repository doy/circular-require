Revision history for circular-require

{{$NEXT}}

0.09  2012-01-07
      - fix some bugs in require VERSION when circular::require is loaded
        (reported by Exodist)

0.08  2012-01-06
      - loading B on demand causes issues, stop doing that
      - deleting CORE::GLOBAL::require on "use circular::require" makes require
        calls that were already bound stop working, stop doing that (it's
        unnecessary now that we're dynamic scoped anyway)
      - bump the perl version requirement to 5.10, since the hint hash didn't exist before then
        - i'd be willing to accept patches to restore the functionality on 5.8,
          i just don't feel like writing it myself
